# Heart Disease Analysis - Tableau Project

## Project Overview
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of mortality worldwide. This project uses **Tableau** as a powerful data visualization and business intelligence tool to analyze heart disease data, transform raw data into meaningful dashboards, and identify correlations that support better decision-making for healthcare providers and policymakers.

This project applies descriptive and diagnostic analytics techniques using Tableau to examine large-scale heart disease data. Through segmentation, correlation analysis, and interactive visualization, the dashboards reveal patterns between lifestyle factors, demographic variables, and clinical indicators contributing to cardiovascular risk.

## Technical Architecture
```
Google Drive/Database → Tableau → Dashboard → Tableau Server → Flask UI → End User
```
